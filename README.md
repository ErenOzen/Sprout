## About The Project

Sprout is an activity summarizer for personal time management. The user enters what kind
of activities they performed during the day (sports, work, video games, meeting with friends). Sprout
then will provide summary reports on groups of activities to give the user a sense of how s/he spends
her time.We created this mobile application using android studio. Firebase used as the
user database solution. Model classes will be prepared using Extensible Markup Language. Unlike modern
android applications, Legacy Android Java Classes will used at every point instead of Kotlin ones.
